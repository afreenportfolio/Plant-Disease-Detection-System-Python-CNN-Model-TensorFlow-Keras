# Plant Disease Detection System
This project employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify diseases in plant images, aiding farmers and researchers in early detection. The model processes images, classifies diseases, and provides insights for better crop management.

Features
1. Image classification using trained CNN models.
2. Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved accuracy.
3. Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics.
4. Automated validation scripts for consistency.

Technologies Used
1. Framework: TensorFlow-Keras
2. Language: Python
3. Tools: Google Jupyter Notebooks
